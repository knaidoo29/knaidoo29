# Krishna Naidoo - Github Repository

Hi, I'm a postdoc at the Center for Theoretical Physics at the Polish Academy of Sciences (CFT PAN) in Warsaw. I work broadly in the area of cosmology working on the cosmic web and high order statistics method such as the minimum spanning tree (for which I developed the python library mistree) and constrained simulations of the local universe.

I love to write code and find myself continuously developing new libraries and analysis pipelines. This is driven by a desire to know how things work and to exploit this knowledge for performance and to push beyond the boundaries of existing status quo software.

I've written a bunch of software libraries which are in various stages of development, you may find some of these useful in your own work. A brief guide on what's available and their various stages of development and future plans are provided below.

### Peer-reviewed libraries

* [MiSTree](https://github.com/knaidoo29/mistree) - A python package for constructing and analysing minimum spanning trees.

### Research libraries

These are libraries which I have spent a considerable amount of time developing and have appeared in some of my research work (paper's and PhD thesis).

> #### General
>
> * [twofast](https://github.com/knaidoo29/twofast)[^1] - Two point correlation function estimator in c++ with OpenMPI parallelisation and python management class for generating input files and running it.
>
> #### Cosmology
>
> * [pyGenISW](https://github.com/knaidoo29/pyGenISW) - Computes the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe using spherical Bessel transforms for data provided in healpix redshift slices.
> * [TheoryCL](https://github.com/knaidoo29/TheoryCL) - Computing auto- and cross-angular power spectra (cl)s for sources in the late universe.

### In-development

> #### General
>
> * [fiesta](https://github.com/knaidoo29/fiesta) - A python library for interpolating fields in 1 to 3 dimensions.
> * [magpie](https://github.com/knaidoo29/magpie) - A python library for remapping pixels into different projections.
> * [shift](https://github.com/knaidoo29/shift) - A python library for performing Fourier transforms defined in polar and spherical polar coordinates.

* [knpy](https://github.com/knaidoo29/knpy) - Personal python library.
